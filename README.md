# FuzzBizzNezz
FuzzBizzNezzAssignment

Written in C as a command line program, this was my second C assignment.

Users input numbers for Fuzz, Bizz and Nezz.

The app prints out all numbers up to whatever was chosen for "Nezz".

At all multiples of "Fuzz", "Fuzz" is written.
At all multiples of "Bizz", "Bizz is written.
At all multiples of both "Fuzz" and "Bizz" "FuzzBizz" is written.
